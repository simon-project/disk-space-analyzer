## P.S.

The author is not a professional developer or a great expert.
The author's developments arise from the emergence of certain tasks and
the absence of ready-made simple solutions, or in cases where such
solutions could not be found or turned out to be too complex or
cumbersome.

You may find here a "bicycle," and not of the most successful design,
reinvented because standard solutions seemed too complicated, or you may
discover "workarounds" that do not look good but nonetheless allow for
movement. Whether to use this is up to you.
